-- CS437 MLB Global Era - WAR Analysis by Player Origin
-- 
-- This file creates materialized views for analyzing Wins Above Replacement (WAR)
-- by player origin and computing the Impact Index metric.
--
-- Prerequisites:
--   - 01_create_db.sql, 03_load_bref_war.sql, and 04_views_analysis.sql must be run first
--   - WAR data must be loaded and parsed via etl/ingest_bref_war.py
--
-- Usage:
--   psql -d mlb -f 06_war_by_origin.sql
